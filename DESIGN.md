## Arabic Restaurant Ordering Multi-Agent System

---

# 1. System Overview

This project implements an **Arabic-language restaurant ordering assistant** designed for messaging platforms such as WhatsApp, web chat, or call-center chat interfaces.

The system is designed using a **multi-agent architecture** where each agent is responsible for a specific stage of the ordering process. Separating responsibilities across agents allows:

* smaller prompts
* clearer reasoning
* easier debugging
* better scalability

The system focuses on **food order placement**, while detecting other intents (such as complaints) and redirecting them appropriately.

---

# 2. Architecture Overview

The system processes a conversation through a pipeline of specialized agents.

### Agent Pipeline

```
User
 │
 ▼
Greeting Agent
 │
 ▼
Location Agent
 │
 ▼
Order Agent
 │
 ▼
Checkout Agent
 │
 ▼
Order Confirmed
```

Each agent performs a specific task and passes minimal context to the next agent.

                    | Confirmed    |
                    +--------------+
```

The architecture separates **conversation reasoning (agents)** from **deterministic business logic (tools)**.

---

# 4. Conversation State Machine

The ordering workflow is modeled as a **conversation state machine**.

This ensures predictable transitions and easier debugging.

### States

| State      | Agent          | Description                    |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| GREETING   | Greeting Agent | Detect user intent             |
| LOCATION   | Location Agent | Validate delivery district     |
| ORDERING   | Order Agent    | Build and modify order         |
| CHECKOUT   | Checkout Agent | Show summary and confirm order |
| ESCALATION | Human Support  | Handle complaints              |

---

### State Transitions

| Current State | Event                  | Next State               |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| GREETING      | delivery order         | LOCATION                 |
| GREETING      | pickup order           | ORDERING                 |
| GREETING      | complaint              | ESCALATION               |
| LOCATION      | district valid         | ORDERING                 |
| LOCATION      | district invalid       | ORDERING (pickup option) |
| ORDERING      | user finished ordering | CHECKOUT                 |
| CHECKOUT      | user modifies order    | ORDERING                 |
| CHECKOUT      | order confirmed        | END                      |

This structure ensures deterministic flow and simplifies debugging.

# 5. Context Management Strategy

Large prompt contexts increase both latency and cost.
This design therefore minimizes prompt size while maintaining the necessary conversational context.

---

## Message Roles

The system uses standard chat message roles.

| Role      | Usage              |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| system    | Agent instructions |
| user      | User input         |
| assistant | Agent response     |

Example:

```
[
 {"role":"system","content":"You are an Arabic restaurant ordering assistant."},
 {"role":"user","content":"أبغى برجر دجاج"}
]
```

---

## Menu Handling Strategy

The restaurant menu contains **100+ items**, which would create large prompts if injected directly.

Instead, the system retrieves menu items via tools.

Example:

User message

```
أبغى برجر دجاج
```

Agent tool call

```
search_menu("برجر دجاج")
```

Tool response

```
[
 {"id":"burger12","name_ar":"برجر دجاج كلاسيك","price":25},
 {"id":"burger14","name_ar":"برجر دجاج سبايسي","price":27}
]
```

Only relevant items are inserted into context.

This dramatically reduces token usage.

---

## Token Budget Estimate

This estimate represents the token usage for a single LLM request.  
A full order flow typically involves multiple LLM interactions across different agents.

Estimated context usage per request:

| Component            | Tokens |
| -------------------- | ------ |
| System instructions  | ~150   |
| Conversation history | ~300   |
| Menu search results  | ~120   |
| Session state        | ~50    |

Estimated total:

```
~620 tokens
```

---

## Conversation History Handling

To avoid context overflow:

* only the **last 6 messages** are included
* structured session state stores order information
* older messages are discarded

Benefits:

* lower latency
* lower cost
* simpler prompts

---

## Context Transfer Between Agents

Only minimal structured context is transferred.

### Context Transfer Rules

To minimize token usage and prevent context explosion, only structured session state is transferred between agents.

| Category | Data |
|---|---|
MUST transfer | intent, delivery type, district, delivery_fee, order_items |
SHOULD transfer | user name, conversation summary |
SHOULD NOT transfer | full conversation history, previous agent prompts |

### Greeting → Location

```
{
 "intent":"delivery_order"
}
```

### Location → Order

```
{
 "district":"النرجس",
 "delivery_fee":15
}
```

### Order → Checkout

```
{
 "items":[...],
 "subtotal":120,
 "delivery_fee":15
}
```

Full chat history and prompts are not transferred.

---

# 6. Deterministic Logic (Reducing LLM Usage)

To improve reliability and reduce cost, the system avoids using LLM reasoning for operations that are deterministic.

Instead, these tasks are implemented using structured tools.

| Operation | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Delivery coverage validation | Local district lookup |
| Menu retrieval | JSON search |
| Order updates | Structured session state |
| Price calculation | Deterministic function |


# 7. Model Selection

Different tasks require different reasoning complexity.

### Why Model Routing Instead of One Model

Using a single large model for all stages would increase latency and cost.  
Simple tasks like greeting and intent detection do not require complex reasoning, so smaller models are used.  
More complex reasoning such as interpreting menu queries benefits from slightly stronger models.

The system therefore uses **model routing**.

| Agent    | Model          | Reason                                                        |
|----------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Greeting | GPT-4o-mini    | Fast intent detection                                        |
| Location | GPT-4o-mini    | Dialogue fallback; district validation handled deterministically |
| Order    | Claude 3 Haiku | Strong reasoning for menu selection                          |
| Checkout | GPT-4o-mini    | Order summarization                                          |

---

## Selection Criteria

### Arabic Capability

Selected models provide reliable Arabic conversational support.

### Latency

Greeting and location agents require fast responses.

### Cost

Routing simple tasks to smaller models reduces cost per order.

### Tool Reliability

Order agent requires reliable function calling.

---

# 8. Edge Case Handling

Robust conversational systems must handle unexpected inputs.

---

## User Changes Order Type

Example

```
خلّيها استلام بدل توصيل
```

Action

* switch order type to pickup
* remove delivery fee
* skip location validation

---

## Item Not On Menu

Example

```
أبغى بيتزا
```

If no results are found:

```
عذراً، هذا الصنف غير موجود في القائمة.
هل ترغب في تجربة شيء مشابه؟
```

---

## Modify Existing Order

Example

```
شيل البطاطس
```

Tool call

```
remove_item(item_id)
```

Order state is updated.

---

## Outside Delivery Coverage

Tool result

```
{"covered": false}
```

Response

```
عذراً، لا نوصل لهذه المنطقة حالياً.
يمكنك اختيار الاستلام من المطعم.
```

---

## Complaint Handling

Example

```
عندي شكوى
```

Action

* escalate to human support
* preserve session context

---

# 9. Logging Strategy

The system logs operational events.

Logged events include:

* agent transitions
* tool calls
* token estimates
* order updates

Example logs

```
[14:23:01] HANDOFF greeting → location
[14:23:03] TOOL check_delivery_district {district: "النرجس"}
[14:23:04] RESULT {covered: true, delivery_fee: 15}
[14:24:10] TOOL add_to_order {item_id: burger12, quantity: 2}
```

Logs improve debugging and monitoring.

---

# 10. Cost and Latency Estimation

Because deterministic logic handles delivery validation and menu retrieval, only a subset of the pipeline requires LLM inference.

LLM calls occur primarily during:

- Greeting (intent understanding)
- Order interpretation
- Checkout confirmation

The **Location Agent** relies on deterministic tools to validate delivery coverage, which avoids an additional LLM call.

---

## Estimated Tokens Per Complete Order

| Stage | Tokens |
|------|------|
Greeting | ~250 |
Ordering | ~500–600 |
Checkout | ~200 |

Estimated total tokens per completed order:

```
~900 – 1100 tokens
```

This aligns with the earlier estimate of **~450–600 tokens per individual LLM request**, multiplied across several agent interactions in the conversation.

---

## Estimated LLM Cost

Using small-model pricing (~$0.0005–$0.002 per 1K tokens):

```
~$0.001 – $0.002 per completed order
```

Because deterministic tools handle menu search and delivery validation, the system avoids unnecessary model calls, significantly reducing operational cost.

---

## Latency Estimate

| Agent | Latency |
|------|------|
Greeting | ~0.5 s |
Location (deterministic) | ~0.1 s |
Ordering | ~1.0 – 1.2 s |
Checkout | ~0.5 s |

Estimated total interaction latency:

```
~2.1 – 2.8 seconds
```

Latency is primarily driven by LLM inference time, while deterministic operations such as menu search and district validation execute almost instantly.

---

## Cost Optimization Strategy

Operational costs are minimized using several strategies:

- deterministic delivery coverage validation
- tool-based menu retrieval instead of injecting the full menu
- limiting conversation history to the most recent messages
- routing simple tasks to smaller models
- caching delivery validation results

These strategies ensure the system remains scalable and cost-efficient even under high order volumes.


---

# 11. Design Tradeoffs

### Tool-based Menu Retrieval vs Prompt Menu

Using tools prevents context overflow and reduces token cost.

### Multi-Agent vs Single Agent

Advantages:

* clearer responsibilities
* smaller prompts
* easier debugging
* easier scaling

### Limited History vs Full History

Short history reduces tokens but slightly reduces conversational memory.

This is acceptable for transactional ordering flows.

---

# 12. Bonus Considerations

## Deployment Strategy

Recommended architecture:

```
Client (WhatsApp / Web)
        │
        ▼
API Gateway
        │
        ▼
FastAPI Agent Service
        │
 ┌──────┴──────────┐
 ▼                 ▼
LLM Provider    Session Store
(OpenRouter)    (Redis)
```

Redis is used to store session state for each conversation, including:
- current order items
- delivery district
- conversation state

This allows the system to remain stateless at the API layer while maintaining persistent order context.

Suggested regions:

* AWS Bahrain (me-south-1)
* GCP Dammam

These provide low latency for Saudi Arabia.

---

## Arabic Language Nuances

Arabic conversation includes dialect mixing and code switching.

Example input

```
أبي large meal
```

The system normalizes common English terms and dialect variations before menu search.

Diacritics are also removed to improve matching.

Example

```
بُرْجَر → برجر
```

---

## Human Escalation

Certain situations trigger escalation.

| Trigger                   | Example                |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Complaint                 | "عندي شكوى"            |
| Repeated misunderstanding | agent fails repeatedly |
| Sensitive requests        | refund requests        |

The system forwards conversation context to a human operator.

---

## Cost Optimization

Costs are reduced by:

* routing simple tasks to smaller models
* retrieving menu items via tools
* limiting prompt history
* caching delivery checks

---

# 13. Summary

This system design emphasizes:

* modular multi-agent architecture
* efficient context management
* tool-based menu retrieval
* scalable deployment
* cost-efficient model usage

The architecture enables a responsive and reliable Arabic ordering assistant suitable for real restaurant messaging systems.
